# Hydroficient IoT Security Externship

## About
In November 2023, hackers breached a Pennsylvania water utility and took control 
of equipment serving over 6,600 customers through internet-connected control systems.

This externship simulates the real world that Hydroficient operates in — building 
IoT-powered water intelligence systems for hotels, hospitals, and apartment complexes, 
while stress-testing their security from the ground up.

## What I Built
An end-to-end IoT data pipeline that monitors water flow, detects leaks, optimizes 
usage, and remotely controls water systems — secured against real-world cyber threats.

## Projects
| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Project 1 | Map Hydroficient's IoT system and identify vulnerabilities |
| Project 2 | Python basics for working with sensor data |
| Project 3 | Build a mock sensor and send data insecurely |
| Project 4 | Add encryption and test performance impact |
| Project 5 | Control which devices are allowed to connect |
| Project 6 | Simulate a replay attack on old commands |
| Project 7 | Build a real-time threat monitoring dashboard |
| Project 8 | Use AI to detect unusual patterns in sensor data |

## Tools & Skills
